# Introduction

Introduce yourself and the agenda for the day
* Introduction
* Coding-dojos
* PrimeFactor kata
* YoseTheGame: the World PrimeFactor

Capture for all to see the expectations and concerns the participants have for this session.

Every sharing moment is an invitation for debates during the training. Adopt a curious stance and welcome violent reactions.

Regular breaks will help sustainable pace. Head up the class every 45 minutes and invite them to take a break.

# Coding dojos

Share with the participants the intentions of the coding-dojos practice. 
Share the following list of intentions (or another that makes more sense for you):
* Learning by repetition
* Create reflexes given a specific situation
* pratice TDD
* practice Refactoring
* practice your hability to identify code smells
* practice pair-programming
* pratice anything that you identify as a weakness in your programming skills

Share (draw / slide) your favorite TDD cycle. Might contain 3 or more steps.
Example:
* Test
* Improve error message
* Code
* Refactor
* A second loop starting from Refactor: Test - Code

Share external resources, for example:
* coding-dojos: http://codingdojo.org/
* code smells: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CodeSmell
 
Share, run and comment one video about you or someone else doing a kata. Choose a short video and choose another kata than the PrimeFactor kata. Discuss the difference between randoris and katas.

Share the idea of Coding-dojos 2.0:
* historical coding-dojos are algorithm challenges
* for some people, it makes sense to practice with more elaborated challenges including Web concerns, GUI, Persistance, etc. We call those Coding-dojos 2.0

http://yosethegame.com/ can be seen as a platform that invite you to practice Coding-dojos 2.0

# PrimeFactors kata

Present the challenge. 

Pomodoro #1: Let the participants form pairs or work alone. Declare yourself available to help. Likely nobody will ask you for help during this first Pomodoro. Enjoy your break while they break a sweat.

Ask for all to share their learning. 

Ask each participant / group what was their first test, what was their second test. Highlight the different test strategies if any. 

Take the time to study how they made pass the first test. Was the smell MagicNumber present after the first green? If so, how did they refactor it?

Encourage the participants to start over. A common trap is to try to solve the PrimeFactors decomposition challenge and to forget that they are here to study TDD. Take the time to welcome their inconfort to start over if they want to complete their algorithm first. 

Pomodoro #2: continue or start over the PrimeFactors kata. Interupt regularly to ask the participants in which step of the TDD cycle they are. 

Ask for all to share their learning. 

Any Duplication in the tests? Point out the different type of Duplication: data and algorithm.

Ask the participants about the names of their tests. Present the BadName smell. Discuss about the intentions of a test, the actual test name, and the actual content of the test. An descrepancies? Any chance that someone else in 6 months from now could understand their test strategy?

Share with the participants your favorite code smells and how you use them. You might say things like:
* My best friends are BadName, PrimitiveObsession, Swith, MagicNumber
* Those are invitations to reconsider my current code
* Study different code smells and know your best friends
* Come back to them when you don't have any intuition about your code
* Know the favorite smells of your teammates
* Try new code smells regularly
 
Repeat as much Pomodoro as you need to cover the important subjects for you at this stage. You can always address them later with a more complex challenge in YoseTheGame. Additional discussions could be:
* What is your first test?
* Could your first test be about the decomposition of 300? If so, what would be the audience of this test? 
* Would you put together tests with different audience?
* How do you understand ATDD?
* What difference do you see between ATDD, BDD, TDD?


# YoseTheGame

Pomodoro is a technique that can help you to switch between sharing moments and focused work.

Participants access their dashboard, navigate to the Power of two challenge and click the Try button. Point out how a written specification can be unclear vs how a test gives you specific expectations.

As they likely already have ready somewhere their implementation of the PrimeFactors kata, they should be able to pass this first challenge easily. They will likely not write any new tests at this point and try to go fast to green in the game.

Let your participants enjoy the game and regularly (Pomodoro) invite them to share their learnings and concerns.

Share when appropriate for you your thoughts about:
* test pyramid, its evolution in time
* outside-in tdd vs inside-out tdd
* London vs Chicago
* London + Chicago !
* Commit strategy
* test-first yes, and assert-first !
