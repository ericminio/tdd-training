# Introduction

Introduce yourself and the agenda for the day
* Introduction
* Coding-dojos
* PrimeFactor kata
* YoseTheGame: the World PrimeFactor

Capture for all to see the expectations and concerns the participants have for this session.

Every sharing moment is an invitation for debates during the training. Adopt a curious stance and welcome violent reactions.

Regular breaks will help sustainable pace. Head up the class every 45 minutes and invite them to take a break.

# Coding dojos

Share with the participants the intentions of the coding-dojos practice. 
Share the following list of intentions (or another that makes more sense for you):
* Learning by repetition
* Create reflexes given a specific situation
* pratice TDD
* practice Refactoring
* pratice your hability to identify code smells

Share (draw / slide) your favorite TDD cycle. Might contain 3 or more steps.
Example:
* Test
* Improve error message
* Code
* Refactor
* A second loop starting from Refactor: Test - Code

Share external resources, for example:
* coding-dojos: http://codingdojo.org/
* code smells: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CodeSmell
 
Share, run and comment one video about you or someone else doing a kata. Choose a short video and choose another kata than the PrimeFactor kata.

Share the idea of Coding-dojos 2.0:
* historical coding-dojos are algorithm challenges
* for some people, it makes sense to practice with more elaborated challenges including Web concerns, GUI, Persistance, etc. We call those Coding-dojos 2.0

http://yosethegame.com/ can be seen as a platform that invite you to practice Coding-dojos 2.0

# PrimeFactors kata

Present the challenge. 

Pomodoro #1: Let the participants form pairs or work alone. Declare yourself available to help. Likely nobody will ask you for help during this first Pomodoro. Enjoy your break while they break a sweat.

At the end of the Pomodoro, ask for all to share their learning. Ask each participant / group what was their first test, what was their second test. Highlight the different test strategies if any. 

Take the time to study how they made pass the first test. Was the smell MagicNumber present after the first green? If so, how did they refactor it?

Encourage the participants to start over. A common trap is to try to solve the PrimeFactors decomposition challenge and to forget that they are here to study TDD. Take the time to welcome their inconfort to start over if they want to complete their algorithm first.
