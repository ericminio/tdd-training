Ask each participant
* To create a player
* To go to his Settings area and set a special tag that you will use to find your class in "Search player"
* Pass the two first levels
* Notify you when they are done with that

Make yourself available to help each participant with deploying their server to pass the first two challenges. 
Some people don't deploy often and it will be difficult for them.

Verify that your class is ready
* visit http://yosethegame.com/players/search/criteria
* Enter your specific tag for the class
* Verify that all participants have a score > 0 (ideally 20)
