Choose a specific tag to identify your class.

Ask each participant
* To create a player
* To go to his Settings area and insert your specific tag in the tags field
* Pass the two first levels
* Notify you when they are done with that

Make yourself available to help each participant with deploying their server to pass the first two challenges. 
Some people don't deploy often and it will be difficult for them.

Verify that your class is ready
* visit http://yosethegame.com/players/search/my-tag
* search for players with your specific tag
* Verify that all your participants have a score > 0 (ideally 20). Contact those who don't and help them
