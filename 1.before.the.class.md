# Yourself

Play the game, explore the different worlds. Start wih the PrimeFactors world that starts with algorihm and then adds a web form in front of it to give access to your algorithm.

Build the solution to the challenges that you'd like to share with the participants to illustrate your learning objectives. Build the refactoring exercices you need for your coming class. For example, take several challenges of the world PrimeFactors and let visible some code smells: Duplication, BadName, SwitchStatement, Comment, ... (More on code smells: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CodeSmell)

Choose a specific tag to identify your class. For example tdd-training-by-bob123-2014-09-21

# Your participants

Ask each participant
* To create a player
* To go to his Settings area and insert your specific tag in the tags field
* Pass the two first levels
* Notify you when they are done with that

Make yourself available to help each participant with deploying their server to pass the first two challenges. 
Some people don't deploy often and it will be difficult for them.
